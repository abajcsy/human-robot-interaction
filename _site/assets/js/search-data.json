    "content": "Robot interaction with people is inevitable: human engineers iteratively tune robot policies, autonomous cars navigate through crowded cities, construction workers teleoperate drones for building inspections, and assistive robots help end-users with daily living tasks. In this graduate class, we will formalize such human-robot interaction (HRI) problems algorithmically. We will build the mathematical foundations for modeling human-robot interaction across robots and tasks, enable robots to understand human intent and predict human behavior, and study how robot learning changes in the presence of human feedback. The approaches covered will draw upon a variety of disciplines and tools such as sequential decision-making, cognitive science, Bayesian inference, and modern machine learning. Throughout the class, there will also be several guest lectures from experts in the field. Students will practice essential research skills including reviewing papers, writing project proposals, and technical communication. In summary, in this class you will learn how to: . | üë©‚Äçüî¨ Mathematically model HRI | üß† Predict human behavior &amp; infer intent | ü§ù Robot learning from human feedback | üôå and more! | . Prerequisites . The course is open to graduate students and advanced undergraduates. There are no official prerequisites but we expect familiarity with robotics and related AI topics (e.g., sequential decision-making / planning, basic machine learning); willingness to conduct a significant final project outside of class time; willingness to read scientific papers and engage in in-class discussions; willingness to conduct in-class presentations about scientific literature. Experience with high-level programming languages like Python are also strongly encouraged. ",

Paper summaries are 1-2 paragraph descriptions of the reading assignments that will be submitted to Canvas. Paper presentations occur during in-class discussions. | Homeworks: This course will have a few implementation-based homeworks that allow you to apply techniques from the class. | Project: Students will engage in a semester-long research project related to the themes of the course before presenting them at the end of the semester. The class project can be either a thorough literature review (‚àº 50 relevant papers, organized so that it identifies gaps in the state of the art) or an exploration of an original research idea. You can choose to work individually or in groups of up to three. We offer an opportunity for extra credit if you discuss your project idea with a course staff member and write a 1 paragraph summary of your idea and discussion which you submit to canvas before Fall break. By this stage, you should have decided if you are doing a project on your own or in a group and you want to motivate the topic you have chosen and the technical questions that you want to investigate. Midway through the semester, students will submit mid-term reports as a checkpoint to ensure that you are making progress towards your final project. The final project consists of an oral project presentation as well as a final project report of the length of a typical robotics or machine learning conference paper (~6 pages). | . | Percentage | Activity | . | 10% | Attendance | . | 30% | HW | . | 10% | Paper Summaries | . | 10% | Midterm Project Report | . | 40% | Final Project | .
