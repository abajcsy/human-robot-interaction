interaction with people is inevitable: human engineers iteratively tune robot policies, autonomous cars navigate through crowded cities, construction workers teleoperate drones for building inspections, and assistive robots help end-users with daily living tasks. In this class we will formalize such human-robot interaction problems algorithmically. We will build the mathematical foundations for modeling human-robot interaction across robots and tasks, enable robots to understand human intent and predict human behavior, and study how robot learning changes in the presence of human feedback. The approaches covered will draw upon a variety of disciplines and tools such as sequential decision-making, cognitive science, Bayesian inference, and modern machine learning. Throughout the class, there will also be several guest lectures from experts in the field. Students will practice essential research skills including reviewing papers, writing project proposals, and technical communication.</p><h2 id="logistics"> <a href="#logistics" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="logistics"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Logistics</h2><ul><li><strong>Title</strong>: Human Robot Interaction, Fall 2025<li><strong>Course Number</strong>: 16-867<li><strong>Lecture</strong>: 11:00AM–12:20PM EST, Tues &amp; Thurs<li><strong>Location</strong>: NSH 3002<li><strong>Office Hours</strong>: Please see “Schedule” tab</ul><h2 id="prerequisites"> <a href="#prerequisites" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="prerequisites"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Prerequisites</h2><p>There are no official prerequisites but expecting familiarity with robotics and related AI topics (e.g., sequential decision-making / planning, basic machine learning); willingness to conduct a significant final project outside of class time; willingness to read scientific papers and engage in in-class discussions; willingness to conduct in-class presentations about scientific literature. Experience with high-level programming languages like Python are also strongly encouraged.</p><h2 id="attendance"> <a href="#attendance" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="attendance"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Attendance</h2><p>Class attendance and participation are key for both your and your peer’s success in this class. You are expected to attend class in person during the scheduled time, including the final presentations. I understand that occasionally you may have challenges attending (e.g., illness, religious observance, etc.). However, if you anticipate having a challenge regularly attending class, please contact me.</p><h2 id="academic-integrity"> <a href="#academic-integrity" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="academic-integrity"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Academic Integrity</h2><p>Honesty and transparency are important features of good scholarship. On the flip side, plagiarism and cheating are serious academic offenses with serious consequences. If you are discovered engaging in either behavior in this course, you will earn a failing grade on the assignment in question, and further disciplinary action may be taken. We encourage you to work together on projects and homework assignments and to make use of campus resources like Student Academic Success Center (SASC) to assist you in your pursuit of academic excellence. However, please note that in accord with the university’s policy you must acknowledge any collaboration or assistance that you receive on work that is to be graded, either from a person, reference, or a tool (including AI-generation tools like ChatGPT).</p><h2 id="late-policy"> <a href="#late-policy" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="late-policy"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Late Policy</h2><p>All homeworks and assignments are assigned due dates and should be submitted through the relevant Canvas portal. If you cannot submit an assignment on time, my default will be to reduce the grade by 10% for each 24 hour period, up to three days, that the assignment is late. This will be automatically applied; you do not have to request it. After three days, the assignment will receive a zero. If you experience an unforseeable emergency and would like me to consider waiving the late penalty, please email me as early as possible to discuss this request. The 10% per day deduction does not apply to unexcused late presentations, which will receive a zero immediately, because they will affect our ability to hold class. Re-scheduling presentations will be based on schedule availability and the professor’s discretion.</p><h2 id="accommodations-for-students-with-disabilities"> <a href="#accommodations-for-students-with-disabilities" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="accommodations-for-students-with-disabilities"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Accommodations for Students with Disabilities</h2><p>If you would like to receive accommodation for a documented disability, please first contact Disability Resources (<a href="access@andrew.cmu.edu">access@andrew.cmu.edu</a> or 412-268-2013). Let us know as soon as possible so we can discuss reasonable accommodations. If you suspect that you may have a disability and would benefit from accommodations but are not yet registered with the Office of Disability Resources, we encourage you to contact them at <a href="access@andrew.cmu.edu">access@andrew.cmu.edu</a>.</p><h2 id="communication"> <a href="#communication" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="communication"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Communication</h2><ul><li><strong>Website</strong>: We will use the class website for posting course content (e.g., lecture notes, paper readings, lecture recordings).<li><strong>Canvas</strong>: We will use Canvas for uploading all assignments and grades.<li><strong>Email</strong>: If you email your instructors, please include the substring “[HRI Course]” to begin a meaningful subject line and have tried to resolve the issue appropriately otherwise.

Instead, grading will be broken down by</p><ul><li><strong>Attendance</strong>: We want students to attend lectures in person consistently. Students are permitted <em>2 unexcused absences</em>, no questions asked, before being docked.<li><strong>Paper Summaries &amp; Presentations</strong>: One goal we have for this course is for you to understand how to consume, explain, and critique research papers. Paper summaries are 1-2 paragraph descriptions of the reading assignments that will be submitted to Canvas. Paper presentations occur during in-class discussions.<li><strong>Homeworks</strong>: This course will have a few implementation-based homeworks that allow you to apply techniques from the class.<li><strong>Project</strong>: Students will engage in a semester-long research project related to the themes of the course before presenting them at the end of the semester. The class project can be either a thorough literature review (∼ 50 relevant papers, organized so that it identifies gaps in the state of the art) or an exploration of an original research idea. You can choose to work individually or in groups of up to three. We offer an <strong>opportunity for extra credit</strong> if you discuss your project idea with a course staff member and write a 1 paragraph summary of your idea and discussion which you submit to canvas before Fall break. By this stage, you should have decided if you are doing a project on your own or in a group and you want to motivate the topic you have chosen and the technical questions that you want to investigate. Midway through the semester, students will submit mid-term reports as a checkpoint to ensure that you are making progress towards your final project. The final project consists of an oral project presentation as well as a final project report of the length of a typical robotics or machine learning conference paper (~6 pages).</ul><div class="table-wrapper"><table><thead><tr><th>Percentage<th>Activity<tbody><tr><td>10%<td>Attendance<tr><td>30%<td>HW<tr><td>10%<td>Paper Summaries<tr><td>10%<td>Midterm Project Report<tr><td>40%<td>Final Project</table></div><h2 id="paper-summaries--presentations"> <a href="#paper-summaries--presentations" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="paper-summaries--presentations"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Paper Summaries &amp; Presentations</h2><h3 id="paper-summaries"> <a href="#paper-summaries" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="paper-summaries"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Paper Summaries</h3><p>There will be several paper discussion days during which you will be as- signed research papers to read. You are expected to complete all assigned readings before class and come prepared with comments and questions to discuss with the group. You will share 1–2 paragraphs with your takeaways or questions on each reading on Canvas, by <strong>10am ET of the day the reading will be discussed.</strong></p><h3 id="paper-presentations"> <a href="#paper-presentations" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="paper-presentations"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Paper Presentations</h3><p>During paper discussion days, we will dive into two papers. During the very first discussion day, we will randomly assign you into groups that you will keep throughout the semester. On each paper discussion day, there will be a set of discussion topics we have generated for each of the papers. In your group, you will discuss the assigned topics. In each group, one person will be randomly assigned to be the group representative who, after the in- class discussion period, will come up and present on the group’s conclusions. The whole class will engage the presenter on their conclusions and takeaways. <em>(Note: this paper presentation structure is subject to change based on class size).</em></p><h2 id="health--wellness"> <a href="#health--wellness" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="health--wellness"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Health &amp; Wellness</h2><p>Take care of yourself. Do your best to maintain a healthy lifestyle this semester by eating well, exercising, avoiding drugs and alcohol, getting enough sleep and taking some time to relax. This will help you achieve your goals and cope with stress.</p><p>All of us benefit from support during times of struggle. There are many helpful resources available on campus and an important part of the college experience is learning how to ask for help. Asking for support sooner rather than later is almost always helpful.</p><p>If you or anyone you know experiences any academic stress, difficult life events, or feelings like anxiety or depression, we strongly encourage you to seek support.
